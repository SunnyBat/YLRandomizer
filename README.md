# YLRandomizer
YLRandomizer is a mod for Yooka-Laylee that integrates it into Archipelago, a multi-world randomizer. This currently only integrates pagies and pagie pickups into the randomizer.

## Known Issues
- The endgame boss fight requires 100 locations to be checked, rather than 100 pagies to be received.
- Disconnecting from Archipelago breaks some assumptions within the mod, and generally requires reloading the save after reconnecting.
